EUCookieDirectiveLite Joomla plugin
===================================

The [nice folks from Channel Digital](http://www.channeldigital.co.uk/) have
implemented a [Joomla Cookie Directive
Plugin](http://www.channeldigital.co.uk/resources/joomla-cookie-directive-plugin.html)
and offer for free a lite version, which is released under the [GNU General
Public License 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License).
This lite version is more than enough for a Spanish Website I have to admin, it
only needed a few string literals translated.

To comply with the GPL, this repository holds the changes done for
[www.tiromadrid.com](http://www.tiromadrid.com) (even though technically by
visiting that web you are *already downloading the modifications*).  The
``master`` branch of this repository holds the original source code as
downloaded from [Channel Digital's
website](http://www.channeldigital.co.uk/resources/joomla-cookie-directive-plugin.html).
The ``tiromadrid`` branch holds the changes done.
